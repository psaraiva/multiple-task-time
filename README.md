# MTT - Multiple Task Time

### Motivation
- Do you do many things almost at the same time?
- Don't know where you spend your time and ask the same question at the end of the day?
- Would you like to have a tool that could keep track of the time spent?
- And who knows, discovering that the various meetings that lead nowhere really do not lead to anything?
- if you have already asked any of these questions above, you are not alone, my motivation is to help you.
